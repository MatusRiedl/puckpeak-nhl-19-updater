"""Overtime game patch, art part: team art (logos, menu jerseys, 3D kits, centre ice) and player portraits from art
packs, served as new archives that the game mounts after its own (overlay layer `art`).

The game's patch loader lists `<root>/databigs/patch_<family>_*.big` and mounts them sorted by name, so the last one
wins. It does this for the UI family (`inxp`) and the 3D family (`game`) separately, and shadPS4's mods overlay merges
the directory listing of `<game folder>-mods/` into the game's. So the art goes into new archives one number above the
game's highest of each family (`patch_inxp_57.big` and `patch_game_97.big` for v1.60), written into the overlay. The
overlay's copies of the game's own archives are never touched.
- A texture the game already has goes into every family that holds a copy, because which family wins over the other
  is not known.
- A new texture (Seattle's t10499) goes into the family that holds its folder's other files.

An art pack is a zip, built on the owner's PC from their own NHL 27 dump and from NHL.com (tools/build_looks.py,
tools/build_photopack.py, tools/build_people.py). Packs are never committed. One pack is made on the player's PC:
the photos the people pack lacks, drawn at Update (overtime_core.photos, people_local.zip in the app's cache).

    pack.json   {"format": 1, "name", "built", "source", "files": {game path: sha256}}
    <path>      each texture as a ready GNF file, stored at its game path (nhl/...)

A delta pack (format 2, the all-team 3D kits: most of a kit's normal / coeff maps is the game's own) also lists
    "deltas": {game path: {"base": sha256 of the game's own file, "sha256": of the result, "size": its length}}
    <path>.delta  the result's 16-byte blocks that differ from the game's file (DELTA_MAGIC, then runs of
                  u32 offset, u32 length, bytes)
and is read with the game folder (load_pack(path, game_dir)): each delta is laid on the game's winning copy of its
path, and a pack whose base does not match that copy (another game version, a modded file) is refused.

Stdlib only: the textures are made when the pack is built, never here (overtime_core.photos draws with Pillow).
