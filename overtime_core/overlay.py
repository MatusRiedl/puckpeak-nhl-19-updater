"""Overtime game patch, data part: what the patch changes in the game's data, served through shadPS4's mods overlay.

`<game folder>-mods/` mirrors the game folder and a file there is served instead of the game's. For every archive
that wins for an edited entry, `apply` writes a copy into the overlay with the edited entries appended
(`eb.append_entry`). The game folder is only read. Layers (each optional):

  text      the Overtime text pack (client/textpack/<lang>.json): the connection texts
  names     Arizona's texts become Utah's (loc ids keyed by art abbreviation PHX and by 22), and "Burnaby", the
            city of customteams 498 (Seattle's AHL club), becomes "Coachella Valley"
  database  a whole default database (nhl_game.db), e.g. the game's default roster brought up to 2026-27, and
            the game's roster file (initial_experience.db) made from it: the game lays that file's 41 rosterupdate
            tables (players, teams, calendars) over nhl_game.db's, so without it modes keep the stock league
            (run x2-20261016/run5: Franchise on Arizona and the stock calendar with only nhl_game.db patched),
            and the Franchise start rosters (expansion_draft.db, entry_draft.db) given the same players
  league    the 2026-27 league for new Franchise / Season leagues (boot.big): capdefs.brk's money table (floor
            and cap $76.9M / $104.0M in place of 2018-19's $58.8M / $79.5M, the CBA's next caps, lowest and
            entry-level salaries per league year), the league creation schemas' $80M limit on a team's cap and
            payroll raised, and the Division Realignment screen (nhlselectteam.lua) set up with the real
            alignment: the league gives each list position its stock division, so the expansion team (Seattle)
            takes slot 22's Pacific position and Utah the expansion team's Central one (run x4-20261016/run2)
  menus     the hub (boot.big homepage.lua / homepage.layout, overtime_core.menus) without Hockey Ultimate Team,
            Draft Champions and World of Chel (no servers); the news tile stays for the text pack's Puck Peak line.
            Its options (menus.OPTIONS: `chel` brings World of Chel back, `news` off drops the news tile) are kept
            in the state file
  art       team art and portraits from art packs (overtime_core.art): NHL 27's logos, menu jerseys, kits and centre
            ice for the 32 teams (Utah on Arizona's art, Seattle at its own art id 10499), NHL.com portraits. These
            go into NEW archives one number above the game's highest of each family (patch_inxp_57.big,
            patch_game_97.big), so no game archive copy is touched; re-applying other layers keeps the art served

`overtime-patch.json` in the overlay lists every file written with its sha256; `undo` removes only those files,
only while unchanged, then the folders left empty. The state is saved as each file lands, so undo reaches stock after a
failed apply too. A file of someone else's at a path the patch writes (a user's own patch archive) is moved into
`overtime-patch-backup/` and put back by undo or by an apply that drops it. Deleting the whole `-mods` folder also
returns the game to stock (and loses such a file).
Nothing is written while shadPS4 runs (it holds the overlay files open and would mix old and new data).
