"""The clubs' 2026 logos and centre ice, made on the player's PC (NHL Legacy's way: a small pack of source pictures,
the game's textures made on the player's own files).

NHL 19's clubs wear their 2018 logos, many clubs have rebranded since, and Update gives club slots another club
(rosterupdate: the AHL's moves, Allsvenskan, take-overs by name). The source pack (tools/build_clubart.py,
packs/clubart.zip, a core download) holds NHL 27's logo of every club of the other leagues as pictures, one lossless
WebP per kind of logo (colour, mono, the small one, the card; the folders that are only resizes of these share one),
and its centre ice where NHL 27 has one:

    pack.json  {"format": 1, "kind": "clubart", "name", "built", "source", "members": {member: sha256},
                "clubs": [{"key", "name", "league", "art", "logos": {folder: member}, "ice": member or null}]}

After an Update is saved (overtime_roster.app.update_ctl) each club slot is matched to a club of the pack by its name
as Update left it (rosterupdate._team_key, the same league first), and the club's pictures are made into the files of
the slot's own art id with gnf.make, on the game's own file as template (size, mips, format; only its header is read):
- every logo folder the game has for that art id;
- the centre ice, when the club's NHL 27 art id is another one: the slot took another club, and the ice_all pack holds
  NHL 27's ice of the art id, not of this club. A club NHL 27 has no centre ice for gets its logo on the slot's own ice
  (the ring kept, the old logo and name gone). A slot that kept its club keeps the ice the other packs give it.
The files go into the app's cache as one more art pack, LOCAL_PACK, which the patch serves after the downloaded packs
(patch.art_packs), so they win there. A second Update with the same pack, matches and game writes nothing (`made`).

Pillow is imported inside the functions only: the server imports overtime_core and stays stdlib.
