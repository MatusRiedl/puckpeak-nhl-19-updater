"""The shadPS4 builds the app plays with (Setup's Boost performance card, the header's Play NHL 19 button). Two builds,
each a pack on the release host pinned by its sha256 in latest.json, never in the exe (owner 2026-11-11, 0.90.2;
order, default and packs from 0.92.0, owner 2026-11-13):
- 'nightly', shown as "Overtime Native" (the default, first on the card, the lobby build of onlineemu.py): Overtime's
  build of upstream nightly 4788f0b + lazy RAM commit, the input poll thread, Kravickas's flip fix and the texture
  collector by seconds (fork branch overtime-nightly, docs/notes/perf-ram.md, native-port.md)
  (packdownload.NIGHTLY_PACK). Overtime publishes it with its releases; the id, folder and pack name keep "nightly"
  (prefs, installed folders and the server's pin URL name them);
- 'kravickas': Kravickas's own CI build of his nhl-test branch (d334436: his fix of the Out of order flip IRQ race on
  upstream main), with Kravickas's yes (owner, 2026-11-01) (packdownload.EMULATOR_PACK). The card's Update is for
  this one: its builds move on GitHub between Overtime's releases.
Each one's shadPS4.exe goes into the app's own folder (a player's own exe is never touched); every shadPS4 there uses
%APPDATA%\\shadPS4, so saves, patch and ShadNet login stay what they are. QtLauncher is not changed (0.90.2; the
"NHL 19 Boost" entry older apps added stays). Standard library only.
