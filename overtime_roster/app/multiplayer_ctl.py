"""Multiplayer: play one friend. Name and ShadNet id, a lobby (create, join by code or from the public list), Ready,
and the game starting by itself once both are ready. docs/ui/multiplayer.md, docs/plans/m3-multiplayer-tab.md.

The lobby is the service in overtime_server/lobby.py, spoken to through lobby_client. The player's ShadNet id is the
account id shadPS4's log prints when NHL 19 signs in (typed when there is no log yet): it is also the game's login
id, which is how the server knows who meets whom. The secret token of the lobby stays in this part, never in the slice.

Polling belongs to the lobby, not to the tab: a thread asks `state` every few seconds from create/join until leave, so
a match keeps going while the player is in the game. It also fills the public list while the tab shows.

The game start (`_launch_job`) is the M2 hook: refuse unless the patch is on and intact, bake the expiring hook
(overlay.set_menus), start shadPS4, press the title screen twice, watch until the game closes, take the hook off.
If NHL 19 already runs, nothing is baked (a rematch: the player presses PLAY in Online Versus).

The match rules (period length, ...) live in the lobby: the host picks them with `mp_set_rule` before Ready, the
partner sees them. At launch each app bakes the lobby's rules into its own game (overtime_core.rules, through the
same overlay as the hook), so both games search with the same ones; a lobby on the defaults bakes nothing.

The History card (recent matches, the players table, a player's pop-up, "Enter result") is the server's match history
(`/api/history`, overtime_server/matches.py) drawn by history_view.py; it is fetched when the tab shows, every
HISTORY_POLL seconds while it does, after the game closes and on every call that changes it.
