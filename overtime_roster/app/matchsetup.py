"""Match-only setup (0.80.0, owner 2026-11-08: "it just works, but for multiplayer from the lobby only").

A lobby match plays on a setup made for that match alone, and the player's own setup comes back when the game closes
(or at the next app start after a crash):

  patch   the host's netplay blocks (what must match), this player's own copy of the shared-local ones (the
          cross-vendor block: it must match too, but is too big for the recipe) and this player's local-only blocks
          (picture size, Be a Pro, the Threes guard, the server's name), written to the app's own match file and passed
          with `-p`. shadPS4 then loads that file instead of the patches folder (memory_patcher.cpp OnGameLoaded), so
          the player's own overtime.xml is never touched (docs/notes/match-setup.md 0a).
  data    a view of the player's `<game>-mods`: every file hardlinked (a copy where links fail), swapped in by rename
          for the match. Overlay writes go through a temp file and os.replace, so a write on the view replaces the
          view's link and the player's file stays as it is; the menus layer (the autoplay hook) is added on the view.
  config  the game's custom config gets the match values (network on, the match timing, DMem for 1440p, AMD math on
          Intel, a log a desync report can read); its exact bytes are kept in the journal and written back after.

The journal (`match-setup.json` in the app folder) is saved before each change, so `restore` can undo any prefix of
`apply`. Nothing here runs while shadPS4 runs. `apply` and `restore` hold one lock (the app-start thread, the
Multiplayer tab and a lobby start may all call them), and a caller that saw one journal restores only that one
(`identity`, restore's `only`): a newer apply's setup is never taken away under it. Standard library only.
