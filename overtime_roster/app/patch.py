"""The game patch from the app's side (Patch tab, tools/game_patch.py): the data overlay (overtime_core.overlay) and
the default roster brought up to 2026-27 for its database layer.

The database layer is the game's own default roster (nhl_game.db) after the same update the Update tab makes:
NHL.com rosters, Utah, Seattle, ratings, lines and the real calendar. With it in the patch, every mode that starts
from the default roster sees the 2026-27 league without loading a custom roster, Seattle filled and active. Only the
expansion career's start roster (overlay.mode_roster_files: expansion_draft.db) has Seattle empty, so the expansion
draft builds the team; that career takes its free agents from this database, so Seattle's players are on its free
agent list too (rosterupdate.expansion_free_agents; other modes do not list a rostered player).

The art layer serves the art packs found (ART_PACKS: NHL 27's team art; built on the owner's PC by tools/build_looks.py,
never committed): switch ART_SWITCH. The packs (all-team logos / menus / centre ice, Utah's and Seattle's whole look, the 3D kits) are downloads
from the release host, never inside the exe; the 3D kits are a delta pack (KITS_PACK, switch `kits`; overtime_roster.
app.packdownload). NHL.com portraits (PHOTOS_PACK, built by tools/build_photopack.py) are keyed by the served bios'
art ids, and the overlay's database step sets each bio's portrait flag from the art served (art.portrait_flags).
NHL 27's other jerseys (the NHL's alternates, the national teams, the clubs) and the NHL kits' 2026 pants are made on
the player's PC at Patch from small layer packs and the game's own files (make_kits, overtime_core.kitcompose), as the
clubs' logos are (make_clubart, overtime_core.clubart): no game texture is downloaded for them.
