"""The online emulator for lobby matches (0.80.0): one shadPS4 build for everyone in a lobby, kept in the app's own
folder by its pack's sha256 and started for lobby matches only. The player's own shadPS4, the Boost switch and
QtLauncher are never changed by it.

It runs on the player's own data (saves, ShadNet sign-in, custom config): shadPS4 takes `user\\` in the folder it starts
from, else %APPDATA%\\shadPS4, so the copy is started from gamesetup.start_dir(the player's own shadPS4)
