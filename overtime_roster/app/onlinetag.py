"""The matchmaking tag (0.81.0, plan WP3): only games that stay in step meet, in open matchmaking and in a lobby.

EA's `<region>_versioninfo.ini` key `onlineVersion` is the game's Blaze gameProtocolVersionString, and the server paired
only equal ones until 2026-11-12; since then matchmaking compares only the part before '-' (game_manager._base_version,
owner's call), and the app's lobby still compares the full tag. The ini is a loose file, so shadPS4's `<game>-mods` overlay
replaces it; the WP1 spike (2026-11-09, docs/notes/crossplay.md) showed the game sends only the first 15 characters.

The tag is the game's own onlineVersion (10 characters at most) + '-' + 4 base-62 characters of a hash of what decides
whether two games play the same math:
  - the game's own onlineVersion (in full),
  - the netplay fingerprint of the patch shadPS4 loads (xmlpatch.netplay_fingerprint: the Cross-CPU block counts),
  - the sha256 of the shadPS4 exe that runs,
  - the CPU math class: 'amd' for an AMD PC and for an Intel PC on a TRUSTED_EXES build with the AMD math key on (that
    build's pass puts AMD's results in, docs/notes/cross-vendor-desync.md); any other is a class of its own.
A setup that would drift apart then waits for its own kind instead of desyncing. 0.80 apps send the bare `NHL19_1.60`,
which no tag equals.

launch.start writes it before every start (apply), the lobby Ready sends the same value from the same inputs
(start_inputs / match_inputs, then sent), Unpatch removes it (remove). Writes go through a temp file and os.replace:
in a lobby match the `-mods` folder is a view of hardlinks (matchsetup.py), and a replace swaps only the view's link.
A start from outside the app (QtLauncher) keeps the last tag written. Standard library only.
